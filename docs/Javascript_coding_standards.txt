Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of coding conventions and rules for use in JavaScript programming.

1. Indentation
--------------
Four spaces are used for indentation.

2. Line Length
--------------

It is 100 characters per line. 

3. Comments
-----------

Comments are used before every function to define it's task. They are also used to tell the use of a particular code block.

Ex: // logic for getting the value from the virtual keyboard

4. Variable Declarations
------------------------

All variables are declared before used. The variables naming convention involves lower pascal case with underscore(_) between two words.

   var incorrect_guesses = 0;       // counter to keep track of the no.of incorrect guesses
   var value_to_use;        	    // array to store the pool set for the game

Use of global variables should be minimized.

5. Function Declarations
------------------------

All functions should be declared before they are used. 
Function naming convention follows lower pascal case with underscore(_).

Ex : function volume_slider() {
	// function body
});

There is no space between the name of a function and the ( (left parenthesis) of its parameter list.
There is one space between the ) (right parenthesis) and the { (left curly brace) that begins the statement body.
The body itself is indented four spaces. The } (right curly brace) is aligned with the line containing the beginning of the declaration of the function.

6. Statements
-------------

Simple Statements
-----------------

Each line should contain one statement. Put a ; (semicolon) at the end of every simple statement.

if Statement
------------

The if class of statements is used having the following form:

    if (condition) {
        statements
    }

    if (condition) {
        statements
    } else {
        statements
    }

    if (condition) {
        statements
    } else if (condition) {
        statements
    } else {
        statements
    }

for Statement
-------------

A for class of statements is used having the following form:

    for (initialization; condition; update) {
        statements
    }

while Statement
---------------

A while statement is used having the following form:

    while (condition) {
        statements
    }

 Whitespace
-------------

Blank lines improve readability by setting off sections of code that are logically related.
